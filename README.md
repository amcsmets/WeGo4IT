# 1. Setting Up the React App

To create a new React app, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app wego4it-react-app
This command sets up a new React project with all necessary configurations.

# 2. Installing Necessary Dependencies

After creating the React app, navigate into the project directory:
cd wego4it-react-app
Then, install the required packages:
• React Router: To manage routing.
• React Scroll: For smooth scrolling behavior.
Install these packages using npm:
npm install react-router-dom react-scroll

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

        ### steps to run:
        1: install serve: npm install -g serve (for the first time)
        2. move the build folder: serve -s build
        3. enter the local server on the browser (For ex: Local: http://localhost:3000 )

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
