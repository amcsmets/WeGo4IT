            At the beginning of 2024, a team of highly skilled IT professionals
            with long-lasting professional relationships founded Aurify. They
            came together because of their shared mindset that was later written
            down as the Aurify Mission Statement at the founding date of the
            company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Aurify Mission is to empower businesses to excel in the digital
            landscape with cutting-edge, secure, and seamless cloud and DevOps
            solutions, 24/7, around the globe, while ensuring financial
            efficiency and strict adherence to security compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thereby, it is Aurify’s Goal to become a leading IT service provider
            with strong foundations in Belgium in order to further extend our
            growth trajectory beyond Northern Europe’s borders.
